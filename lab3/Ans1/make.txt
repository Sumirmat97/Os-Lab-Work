	a. To resolve dependancies use gcc's various -M flags to generate the dependencies and then -include them in Makefile.
	b. 	Since we cannot write the name of files in the recipe of the make file we use these symbols which are known as automatic variables.
		'$<' used to represent the source file name. 
		'$@' used to represent the object file name 
		'$^' used to represent the names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.
		
	c.	To build a code when there are multiple makefiles in the system: 
		i) give different names to the makefiles eg. makefile.win and makefile.nix.
		ii) In another makefile file write the lines
			win:
			  make -f makefile.win

			nix:
			  make -f makefile.nix
			 
			and use make win or make nix to use any of the required makefiles.
			
	
	d. The ans of the d part is in main.c,myFile.h,myFile.c
		myFile.h contains the declaration of the function getRoot defined in myFile.c and called in main.c
